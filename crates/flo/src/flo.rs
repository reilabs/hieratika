//! The in-memory representation of a `FlatLoweredObject`, as used for working
//! with `FLO`s.
//!
//! This type can be used with the following modules in this crate:
//!
//! - The `linking` module allows one to link in additional FLO modules.
//! - The `cairo` module allows one to emit Cairo `FlatLowered` directly.
